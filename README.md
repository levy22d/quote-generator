# quote-generator
This is a small project using jQuery, Javascript, HTML, and CSS that:
 - Generates a random quote from an external API on load.
 - Generates a random quote from the API on click.
 - Loads a new photo background from a few different background options on reload.

Credits to Luke Peavy's *Quotable API* for quotes.
